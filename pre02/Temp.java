/*
Write a program that converts a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit. It should (1) prompt the user for input, (2) read a double value from the keyboard, (3) calculate the result, and (4) format the output to one decimal place. For example, it should display "24.0 C = 75.2 F".
Here is the formula. Be careful not to use integer division!
